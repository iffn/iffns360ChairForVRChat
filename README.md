# iffns360ChairForVRChat
A script that allows desktop players to turn 180Â° in either direction.
Especially usefull in SaccFlight vehicles. Attach to the station and set the appropriate HeadXOffset value.
 
Requires VRChat SDK3 for Worlds, the compatible Unity version and UdonSharp 0.20.3 or higher.

### Integration without Submodules
To maintain compatability with other projects, please put everything into ```/Assets/iffnsStuff/iffns360ChairForVRChat``` 

### Git Submodule integration
Add this submodule with the following git command (Assuming the root of your Git project is the Unity project folder)
```
git submodule add https://github.com/iffn/iffns360ChairForVRChat.git Assets/iffnsStuff/iffns360ChairForVRChat
```

If you have manually added it, use this one first. (I recommend to close the Unity project first)
```
git rm Assets/iffns360ChairForVRChat -r
```
