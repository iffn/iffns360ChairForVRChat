### Integration without Submodules
To maintain compatability with other projects, please put everything into ```/Assets/iffnsStuff/iffns360ChairForVRChat``` 

### Git Submodule integration
Add this submodule with the following git command (Assuming the root of your Git project is the Unity project folder)
```
git submodule add https://github.com/iffn/iffns360ChairForVRChat.git Assets/iffnsStuff/iffns360ChairForVRChat
```

If you have manually added it, use this one first. (I recommend to close the Unity project first)
```
git rm Assets/iffns360ChairForVRChat -r
```
